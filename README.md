Airflow is a serverless web framework for Node.js optimized for deploying your endpoints as cloud code. This removes the need to maintain your own servers. Whether your API has one endpoint or ten thousand, the process of testing and deploying your web app should be simple.

The only provider currently supported is Amazon Web Services (utilizing Lambda and API Gateway), but more providers are coming in the future.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install airflow -g
```
